## Cloud & Infrastructure as a Service Basics with DigitalOcean - Tech World DevOps Bootcamp

### Cloud Essentials

**Introduction to Cloud Computing:**
Cloud computing is a paradigm that provides on-demand computing resources over the internet. It enables users to access and utilize computing power, storage, and other services without the need for physical hardware.

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
IaaS is a cloud computing model that delivers virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components, paying only for the resources they consume.
